# My portfolio webpage!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Custom components

The single page app features completely custom components by me. A fun feature includes the wipe-away page transition powered by framer-motion.

## Mobile responsive

The page can adjust to quite a few screen sizes and has its own mobile experience.

## Testing

I am currently writing tests for the page as an example use-case of Jest, Enzyme and Cypress.

## Accessibility in mind

The whole web should be accessible! I have laid the foundation of accessibilty within the page but you better believe I'll be testing it thoroughly to create the most accessibly friendly experience possible.
