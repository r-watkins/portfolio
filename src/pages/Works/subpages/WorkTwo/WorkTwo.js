          <h6>Creating new spaces</h6>

          <br />

          <p>
            The ArcGIS Indoors team was in the design phase for a new companion
            app to Indoors called Spaceplanner. Spaceplanner would be an
            administrative tool used to manage building, room and office
            occupancy. The team needed to make the deadline for a recent release
            of ArcGIS Pro so they called me in to help develop the UI.

          <h6>Planning and Building</h6>

          <br />

          <p>
            The solution was built on ReactJS and used the new Calcite-React
            which was becoming the preferred component library over Material UI
            in Professional Services. At this point I was seasoned in both and
            very comfortable in working with the technology.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            The biggest challenge for this project was the designs were still in
            a wireframe stage. The designer and developers had to work very
            closely to reveal and implement the styles and workflows as we
            progressed.

          <h6>Standing out</h6>

          <br />

          <p>
            I was one of three UI developers on the project. I immediately
            identified a need to unify the styling system of the project. The
            current solution was written in a mix of plain CSS and Sass. I made
            the call that they switch to styled-components and began work on
            replacing the old styles with the new. I knew Calcite-React was
            written with styled-components so their integration was simple and
            seamless.

          </figure>

          <br />

          <p>
            My other responsibilities were to build the right panel complete
            with search, filter and sorting capability. The cards also needed to
            show a color code for empty and occupied.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            There were layout issues having a right and left drawer panel
            initially and I took charge rewriting the layout to scale properly,
            especially on smaller screens. The initial design also had a
            floating header which also couldnâ€™t scale properly given its
            children elements. I helped rework the header into a more
            sustainable design.

          <p>
            In the end, we made the deadline with a beautiful and useable
            solution.
