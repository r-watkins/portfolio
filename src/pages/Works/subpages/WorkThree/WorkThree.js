          <h6>Pick Up and Run</h6>

          <br />

          <p>
            The previous maintainer of Calcite UI Icons React or CUI Icons React
            as I refer to it, needed to offload the repo. I took up the mantle
            of maintainer which is nothing particularly special except that I
            had a plan to make the library just that more usable.

          <h6>Planning and Building</h6>

          <br />

          <p>
            In generating the new React based icons from the CUI Icons, the
            filename had to be written from a hyphenated form to camel case.
            Numbers also needed to be spelled out for React component files
            names, i.e. 3 would become Three. This creates a bit of a disconnect
            when a developer goes to look for an icon they want to use in the
            CUI Icons library but itâ€™s not exactly the same file name when
            referencing it in CUI Icons React. So, I decided to build a new icon
            reference page specifically for the React icon file names.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h6>Making Life Easier</h6>

          <br />

          <p>
            I wrote a Node script to generate the icon components and copy the
            imports and layout into a single file so it can be delivered to a
            web page. The app itself was a quick and easy build with React and
            Calcite-React. Style customizations were done using
            styled-components.
          </p>

          <p>
            The app allows for a file name search and lets users test icon size.
            The most important feature is the ability to copy an icon file name
            or import statement with the click of button.
          </p>
